## Overview

FlowSafe is a comprehensive AI-powered Smart Health Surveillance and Early Warning System designed to detect, monitor, and prevent outbreaks of water-borne diseases in vulnerable communities, particularly in rural areas and tribal belts of the Northeastern Region (NER).

The system combines advanced water quality monitoring, comprehensive health data collection, emergency reporting, real-time analytics, disease surveillance, community reporting, and educational modules to create a complete solution for water-borne disease prevention including **Diarrhea, Cholera, Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and Dysentery**.

**New in 2025**: FlowSafe now features a complete **Health Data Collection Ecosystem** with dedicated interfaces for ASHA workers, community volunteers, and local clinics, comprehensive **Emergency Reporting System**, advanced **Analytics Dashboards** with interactive charts, and **Field Survey Management** capabilities.

By integrating IoT sensors, mobile health reporting, AI-based outbreak prediction, comprehensive data analytics, and emergency response systems, FlowSafe empowers health workers, community volunteers, and local governance bodies to take proactive measures before outbreaks occur.
